On our first day, we attended the flag-raising ceremony, which ended around 9:00 AM. At 9:30 AM, we returned to the function hall to attend another activity. After that, we were assisted and brought to the office of Ma’am Sittie (Regional Director). She asked about our skills, and both Cadigal and I were sent to the security office. However, only Cadigal was selected, so I returned to the TOD office and waited for further instructions.

Around 10:00 AM, we were called back to the function hall where Sir Jeniel Wabe oriented us about our tasks. We were assigned to the TWG (Technical Working Group). After the orientation, we had our lunch break. In the afternoon, the orientation continued, and we were asked to help prepare materials for the upcoming event at N-Hotel Kauswagan. We cut and prepared name tags and pliers for the event.',NULL,'2026-01-14 15:49:28','2026-01-14 15:49:28');
